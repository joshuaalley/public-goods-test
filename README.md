In this paper, I conduct an empirical assesment of Olson and Zeckhauser's 1996 [Economic Theory of Alliances](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1927082). 
Olson and Zeckhauser argue that alliances are subject to a collective action problem. 
Larger alliance members will bear a disproportionate share of the burden of providing security. 

While the concept of free-riding is often invoked in discussions of alliance politics, there is little solid empirical evidence for or against Olson and Zeckhauser's model. 
I rectify this gap in knowledge by estimating two models of national military spending from 1816 to 2007. 
One interacts changes in allied military expenditures and GDP.
The other estimates the correlation between alliance contribution and military spending for 285 alliances. 
Neither approach supports Olson and Zeckhauser's predictions.
